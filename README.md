  Morgan shouldn't be installed as dev dependency. Partial mark assigned.
  
  ##### I do not agree
  
  Morgan should just use in development
  
  
  
  ### A successfully submitted cluck redirects the user to the index page.	❌	Redirected to the show page  
  
  
  ##### not agree
  
  
  I redirected a full control page, included back to index list and also included the "Edit" and "Delete" feature.   This was not required by the quiz instruction but it needed to be included because the database->clucks table had updated_at fields. If there wasn't this feature, then this field will be of no use.
